# Statement on Palestine

**Effective Date:** September 13, 2025

At chriscentrella.com, we believe in human dignity, justice, and the right of all people to live free from oppression and violence.

We stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine, who have faced decades of displacement, inequality, and loss. Supporting Palestinian rights does not mean denying the rights of others â€” it means affirming that freedom and justice must be universal.

We reject all forms of antisemitism, Islamophobia, and hate. Our stance is against systems of oppression, not against any people or faith.

This statement is part of an ongoing commitment to align our work and our community with values of empathy, equity, and care. We encourage learning, dialogue, and action toward a future where Palestinians, Israelis, and all people can live with dignity and peace.
