# Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement

**Effective Date:** September 13, 2025

## 1. Commitment

At **chriscentrella.com**, we are committed to conducting all business with integrity, fairness, and respect for human rights. We oppose all forms of modern slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking, and we take steps to ensure these practices are not present in our operations or supply chains.

## 2. Our Business

This website is primarily a personal and professional platform created by **Chris Centrella**. While operations are small-scale, we recognize the importance of ensuring ethical practices in all business relationships, including partnerships, vendors, and service providers.

## 3. Supply Chains

Where we work with third-party providers (such as hosting services, payment platforms, or software tools), we expect those organizations to uphold the same standards of transparency, accountability, and human rights protections.

## 4. Policies and Practices

To help prevent modern slavery:

- We review suppliers and partners for their ethical and labor standards
- We avoid working with organizations that fail to demonstrate clear commitments to human rights
- We encourage transparency and accountability across any collaborations

## 5. Training and Awareness

Although this is a small-scale operation, we stay informed on best practices around human rights and modern slavery prevention, ensuring that decisions and partnerships are aligned with these values.

## 6. Reporting Concerns
